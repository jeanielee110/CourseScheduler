# Course Scheduler
Our goal is to make a web application that can be used to construct potential course schedules. Besides enabling prospective students to think about courses they might be interested in, the application can also replace paper forms that newly matriculated students currently use to plan their course load.

## Setup

### PostgreSQL
[PostgreSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) is a cross-platform object-relational database management system (ORBDMS). The release we are using is 9.4.2, released on May 22nd, 2015.
1. For OS X, the simplest way to get PostgreSQL installed is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), a package manager for OS X. Follow the installation instructions at the Homebrew site.
2. After installing Homebrew, run `brew install postgresql` in Terminal.
